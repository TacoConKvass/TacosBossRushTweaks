Boss Rush feels to easy for you? We have a solution!
During Boss Rush, all bosses have reactive Damage Reduction - the lower their HP gets, the more damage they will resist!
Also has config options for enabling:
- normal music for bosses during Boss Rush (off by default)
- repeating the introductory Boss Rush monologue (on by default)
